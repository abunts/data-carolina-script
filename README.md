## Development

1. Install dependencies

```shell
npm ci
```

2. Start local development server

```shell
npm start
```

3. Coding Loop

Navigate to `http://localhost:3030` in your browser. Code changes will be reflected immediately with the help of [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/). (To serve the application on a port other than 3030, set an environment variable `PORT` to the desired port.)
